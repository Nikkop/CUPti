(leading to statements that, out of his twisted context, are totally bewildering like "its capabilities are complex".)\nhis argument about simplicity and complexity not being mutually exclusive is a matter of definition, and thus he undermines others by foisting his definition into their mouths and then screaming bloody murder when he deduces that changing the premises of someone's argument does indeed damage its conclusions.\namong other things i think his comparison of stats between mongrel and fogbugz is fundamentally broken. mongrel is among other things free. beyond the intense need to brag about his project's success i can't see any legitimate reason for making that particular comparison.\n(beyond this point i rant about his usage of hangul for his example, feel free to skip rest of post.)\nhis comprehension of the korean writing system, which is one of his "powerful" points, seems superficial at best. hangul is a language that was designed by a small group of advisors when the royalty realized most koreans were illiterate (not enough resources to spend learning chinese kanji). how the hell are we supposed to be surprised that something explicitly designed to be simple, in fact, turned out to be simple? some extra points can be deducted for the fact that they stopped using hangul for several hundred years until it was institutionalized by the strong nationalist movement post wwii and made the official writing system in an effort to establish a unique korean culture. additionally we can pause curiously while noting that the average korean still uses 700-800 chinese kanji in daily life, and that academic papers still use the kanji for particularly esoteric or complex concepts (although this is increasingly discouraged as it is viewed as elitism). he crucifies joel and don for using limited examples to justify a point... and then use a single example to prove his, along with unsubstantiated claims about linguistic researchers. the japanese katakana alphabet can represent many words very well... until you try to do one with an l in it, and then it fails utterly. using one contrived example wouldn't reveal that, and its the same reason i doubt his point about hangul.\nbeyond technicalities, its ignorant to conflate the creation of one small group of individuals six hundred years ago with the cultural preferences of modern korea. using something as an example never works out if you don't actually know about it.

(note i didn't use the term 'hackers' because although i don't code, i would consider myself someone who works to "design beautiful software.")\n

(then again, they're probably still too busy counting the $3.2bn from their cisco acquisition to notice.)  powerpoint is huge in medium/large companies, and the tools available for delivering ppt presentations remotely still suck. and aside from providing awesome presentation design functionality, zenter would've absolutely given webex a run for its money on the presentation delivery side.

"this is facebook.  you can connect with your friends and see what they've been up to.  imagine the possibilities." - 2006.ten years later, the young people who would then be in their mid-20s would laugh at the people who did not realize its potential when they were 15.  duh!to most of us, the web is obvious, and even google seems obvious because many web portals and web directories existed with search ability--google was just making it better--but to think of facebook being huge is just not obvious to us.  but, to the 14 year olds growing up, facebook and myspace are important for many things where google is just good for researching stuff and images for school, and wikipedia is good for getting basic information for school projects.  in other words, i don't think most young people care about google's apps other than search.  (sure, they might use maps, but via embedded javascript in facebook and myspace in the future, and the treos and iphone come standard with a native gmaps application already.)

(who knows maybe we can submit to the ycombinator winter application...)i'm still debating whether i should keep user registration open since it's not polished enough to mass market... let me know what you guys think.

(exclamation point is part of it): http://www.act.com/?not sure they have a web app, but they are one of many popular software apps that accomplish what you are talking about.  i remember having act! 2.0 in the mid-90s.i'm looking at their site and i don't see a web app, though i'm not sure and i think it would absolutely crazy if they didn't.

105    i am in almost the exact same situation, except with 2 years of hindsight.  i joined a startup straight out of college as employee #13 (at the time, it had about 8 employees in the office at any given time).  it was profitable, i liked the people, and they were doing some pretty cool stuff.overall, i would do it over again but probably will not remain with them for much longer, if that makes any sense.   some observations:the language choice will grate on you after a while.  i dunno what the background of posters saying "be professional.  suck it up." is, but i actually liked java coding when i started, and have since learned to hate it.  if you're going in with a strong aversion to java &#38; c++ already, it'll probably only get worse.flip side is that you do get better at these languages after you work with them a while, as long as you keep an open mind.  there are tricks and tools in c++ to help you manage memory - you shouldn't be tracing pointers from new to delete.  and java's verbosity isn't as bad once you get used it and consider "for(int i = 0; i &#60; array.length; ++i)...." to be a single map function that just has a really long name. ;-)one question to ask that'll help you determine if the language will end up becoming a total drag: are they using it because the problem fits the language's strengths, or are they using it because they don't know any better and aren't comfortable with multi-language solutions?  every mainstream language is good for something.  in my case, i was perfectly happy as long as i was writing ide plugins and server software in java, and then became very unhappy once i had to write a webapp.  (imnsho, java is irredeemably broken for webapps; the only sane way to do them is to strip out all the javaee bullshit and program on bare servlets, but then you get something that's nowhere near as nice as python/php/perl.)there are plenty of things beyond programming that you learn from working in a successful (profitable) startup.  otoh, it's not rocket science.  basically, you can boil it all down to: 1.) make something people want, 2.) charge more for it than it costs you, and 3.) fix problems now rather than later.  every failed startup i've been involved with has neglected at least one of these: every successful startup has done all three.i dunno what you expect financially out of this, but be aware that founders get rich, late-stage employees get paid, and early-stage employees get screwed.  at least in proportion to the amount of effort they put in.  one startup i worked in went bust, taking my 0.1% of stock options with it.  one that i interviewed at offered me about 0.01% of the company; i did the math, and calculated that at their expected $40m exit, i would get a whole $4000.  i have no equity at my current employer.  my cubemate was an early employee at ccbn, which was sold to thomson for about $40m.  he got $3k or so.  i have another friend who was employee #35 at stratus and later a vp; she was rich for a while when they ended up with a billion-$ market cap, but ended up poor again after the stock crashed.  if you plan on being an early employee at a startup, you should do it for learning or for the experience rather than any perceived financial rewards.

"hi, i'm _____ and my job is to make this [kick ass images] happen"one request i have is don't talk as if this is something for those only naturally talented in math and logical thinking. teachers want them to see potential in themselves to improve, even if they are behind, if they start hitting the books now they can do something like programming.lay out in no uncertain terms how one might progress if they are interested in the subject. when i was that age, maybe a bit older, there were some fields i was interested in but it was all just pie in the sky kind of stuff to me. stuff you learned in college. not connected with the drivel at junior high level.i second the call to not use the word "hacker" rms lost that battle to hollywood a long time ago. the kids will find the true meaning to it later. coder, programmer, technical director (?) are some ideas.\n

"the total cost of this round of funding" doesn't make sense so much. and surely the rate of increased value of your company matters.also, it seems, like you note in the end, that there is still a gut feeling, and here it is stated simply: how can you predict how much your company will grow because of an investment?this is easier if you have sales numbers that show some trend, where investing $n in business development yields x more users leading to y more profit. if you're reddit, and you haven't even monetized your users before being purchased, this can be harder. also organic growth implies less direct business development.one simple question that i think has a standard/gaap answer: how much is your company worth if you are making $x yearly and growing at a rate of y%? i vaguely recall terms like "good-will estimates" and "present value of future money" in the single management class i've taken years ago. but is there something standard for a company going through valuation for acquisition or taking a next round of funding. [ignore for the moment that a company making a nice profit and growing ideally wouldn't need a next round of funding.]

(e.g. provide a service people want) if you want to optimize your per-hour take (since you are bound by your time if you work solo that is the only thing you can significantly maximize) keep on top of your skills and move with the market.

(sounds pretty boring to me). this is an important question to ask yourself. what is going to be the best step to where you want to be later on?\n

'marketing companies' are sometimes profitable, but rarely maintain a commanding market position for long if they get there in the first place. contrast these with the real product companies of our time: apple, google, craigslist, facebook, toyota. the real profit and value are being created by companies who focus on actual products. some of these companies have little marketing apparatus at all, at least in the sense you're talking about. this reminds me of a silly aphorism: you rob a bank because that's where the money is. providing seed funding to 'marketing geniuses' is like robbing twenty hot dog stands and hoping that one of them forgot to deposit their earnings that week. it's only a good plan if you can't figure out how to rob the bank.

(you get sql queries for free). where you expect concurrent access and high loads, a client-server still suits better. somebody correct me if i'm wrong.

(or is it the metabubble?)you'd think that after living through two real bubbles we might develop some higher standards. instead, the word "bubble" is getting applied to every fad, era, technology, and press release that comes along.

(yes, i know why this is impossible with browser features, but it's what i expect from a music player) oh, and it only seems to accept .mp3 files -- i've got a fair number of .ogg, .wma, .aac, etc. that's probably my computer's doing, though, since it wouldn't be a very good itunes clone without insisting on .aac.

giving up . some founder go back to school and keep working on the startup while there . however , those do so much worse than the people who work on the startup full-time that going back to school seems , in practice , not too far removed from a death sentence for a startup.off the top of my head , i 'd guess we 've had about 8 startup where the founder went back to school . it doe n't only happen with summer batch . founder from winter batch do it too.usually the reason is that the startup is n't doing very well . however , that judgement depends a lot on how determined the founder are . one reason we now shy away from funding people still in school is that they often unconsciously want the startup to fail , because the idea of dropping out frightens them.a lot of startup look bad after 3 month . someone who 's out of school and ha to make it work or get a job in a cubicle will say `` do n't worry , we 'll figure out how to make it successful .

'' in order to sound edgy he subverts the meaning of complex into something that it doe n't mean ( powerful ) , and base his entire argument on this sleight of hand . ( leading to statement that , out of his twisted context , are totally bewildering like `` it capability are complex '' . ) his argument about simplicity and complexity not being mutually exclusive is a matter of definition , and thus he undermines others by foisting his definition into their mouth and then screaming bloody murder when he deduces that changing the premise of someone 's argument doe indeed damage it conclusion . among other thing i think his comparison of stats between mongrel and fogbugz is fundamentally broken . mongrel is among other thing free . beyond the intense need to brag about his project 's success i ca n't see any legitimate reason for making that particular comparison . ( beyond this point i rant about his usage of hangul for his example , feel free to skip rest of post . ) his comprehension of the korean writing system , which is one of his `` powerful '' point , seems superficial at best . hangul is a language that wa designed by a small group of advisor when the royalty realized most korean were illiterate ( not enough resource to spend learning chinese kanji ) . how the hell are we supposed to be surprised that something explicitly designed to be simple , in fact , turned out to be simple ? some extra point can be deducted for the fact that they stopped using hangul for several hundred year until it wa institutionalized by the strong nationalist movement post wwii and made the official writing system in an effort to establish a unique korean culture . additionally we can pause curiously while noting that the average korean still us 700-800 chinese kanji in daily life , and that academic paper still use the kanji for particularly esoteric or complex concept ( although this is increasingly discouraged a it is viewed a elitism ) . he crucifies joel and don for using limited example to justify a point ... and then use a single example to prove his , along with unsubstantiated claim about linguistic researcher . the japanese katakana alphabet can represent many word very well ... until you try to do one with an l in it , and then it fails utterly . using one contrived example would n't reveal that , and it the same reason i doubt his point about hangul . beyond technicality , it ignorant to conflate the creation of one small group of individual six hundred year ago with the cultural preference of modern korea . using something a an example never work out if you do n't actually know about it .

'' . turn out `` mongrel '' is a web server and not a bug tracker . so , i 'm guessing zed never heard the one about the apple and the orange .... i read up until he started criticising the apache web server . now , i wo n't claim to be an expert , but i 'm guessing there 's a reason beyong it being a `` big turd '' for the 2 billion installations.oh , well . tip to writer : a long a you are anonymous , pour on the bile . who care ? but when you 've got your name attached , do n't actively try to make every enemy you can .

'' i just bought a 22 '' widescreen for $ 200 . i certainly appreciate all the extra real estate , and yet i ca n't deny that i could find a use for more . i 'm considering plugging my old crt into my integrated video card , but it produce so much heat compared to a flat panel .

'' in a 2-person startup , do you think both people need to be software developer ? i 'm an interaction designer , and so although i do the html and cs , my real contribution to the team is my focus on the persona , the design , and the user experience , while my partner focus on the implementation . so far , thing have been moving along at a nice clip , but i 'd like to hear your take on this issue . ( note i did n't use the term 'hackers ' because although i do n't code , i would consider myself someone who work to `` design beautiful software . '' )

'' . most cad software for instance ha version control a the entry point , not at the end . when i did a stint in an office environment i wa appalled at their version control ( it 's on the cfo 's hard drive and he just re-saves it a a new version - not neccesarily date driven ... ) and wa in a meeting with their multi-million budget review when two vp 's discovered they were reporting actuals v budget from two different version ( not sure if one or both were wrong ... ) . what problem/value doe versionate give to customer ? imho an unbelievable amount - centralised storage ( even on your own server ) , a weblink that only ha the currently released best version , the ability to import/export - these are all very good thing . i really hope you guy do well . oh and btw , i love the pricing scheme .

'' - 2006.ten year later , the young people who would then be in their mid-20s would laugh at the people who did not realize it potential when they were 15. duh ! to most of u , the web is obvious , and even google seems obvious because many web portal and web directory existed with search ability -- google wa just making it better -- but to think of facebook being huge is just not obvious to u . but , to the 14 year old growing up , facebook and myspace are important for many thing where google is just good for researching stuff and image for school , and wikipedia is good for getting basic information for school project . in other word , i do n't think most young people care about google 's apps other than search . ( sure , they might use map , but via embedded javascript in facebook and myspace in the future , and the treos and iphone come standard with a native gmaps application already . )

'' but they did n't read the mouse print on the term of service page that say facebook can share it with whoever they want . if george orwell only knew it would be this easy .

105    i am in almost the exact same situation , except with 2 year of hindsight . i joined a startup straight out of college a employee # 13 ( at the time , it had about 8 employee in the office at any given time ) . it wa profitable , i liked the people , and they were doing some pretty cool stuff.overall , i would do it over again but probably will not remain with them for much longer , if that make any sense . some observation : the language choice will grate on you after a while . i dunno what the background of poster saying `` be professional . suck it up . '' is , but i actually liked java coding when i started , and have since learned to hate it . if you 're going in with a strong aversion to java & # 38 ; c++ already , it 'll probably only get worse.flip side is that you do get better at these language after you work with them a while , a long a you keep an open mind . there are trick and tool in c++ to help you manage memory - you should n't be tracing pointer from new to delete . and java 's verbosity is n't a bad once you get used it and consider `` for ( int i = 0 ; i & # 60 ; array.length ; ++i ) .... '' to be a single map function that just ha a really long name . ; - ) one question to ask that 'll help you determine if the language will end up becoming a total drag : are they using it because the problem fit the language 's strength , or are they using it because they do n't know any better and are n't comfortable with multi-language solution ? every mainstream language is good for something . in my case , i wa perfectly happy a long a i wa writing ide plugins and server software in java , and then became very unhappy once i had to write a webapp . ( imnsho , java is irredeemably broken for webapps ; the only sane way to do them is to strip out all the javaee bullshit and program on bare servlets , but then you get something that 's nowhere near a nice a python/php/perl . ) there are plenty of thing beyond programming that you learn from working in a successful ( profitable ) startup . otoh , it 's not rocket science . basically , you can boil it all down to : 1 . ) make something people want , 2 . ) charge more for it than it cost you , and 3 . ) fix problem now rather than later . every failed startup i 've been involved with ha neglected at least one of these : every successful startup ha done all three.i dunno what you expect financially out of this , but be aware that founder get rich , late-stage employee get paid , and early-stage employee get screwed . at least in proportion to the amount of effort they put in . one startup i worked in went bust , taking my 0.1 % of stock option with it . one that i interviewed at offered me about 0.01 % of the company ; i did the math , and calculated that at their expected $ 40m exit , i would get a whole $ 4000 . i have no equity at my current employer . my cubemate wa an early employee at ccbn , which wa sold to thomson for about $ 40m . he got $ 3k or so . i have another friend who wa employee # 35 at stratus and later a vp ; she wa rich for a while when they ended up with a billion- $ market cap , but ended up poor again after the stock crashed . if you plan on being an early employee at a startup , you should do it for learning or for the experience rather than any perceived financial reward .

( i 'd go for html , javascript . biggest reason is that it 's easily accessible everywhere , and come with a decent ui toolkit and turing complete language ) i 'm assuming you have been invited since you are a practising professional . it 's the job of the teacher to explain how thing will be ( point 2 to 5 ) . you ought to be that person in front of them for those few hours.walk the talk . show the enthu in your eye , voice . kid pick up such thing better than any word . every gesture in your body language will matter . unless you successfully come across a cool , 4 ) will be a waste.hope that help : )

'' they get you to write some , following by popular `` optimize for speed/memory '' and so on.i just recently had somewhat similar idea : to reverse table and ask them to interview me . not the typical `` how do you like it here ? '' kind , but i want to ask people to ask me technical question and see what they can come up with .

[ ignore for the moment that a company making a nice profit and growing ideally would n't need a next round of funding . ]

'' there are also opportunity cost to consider , so your early employee or co-founders could be off starting their own company with a lot more equity . so it 's probably going to vary by each person , but in my experience , the vested equity ha to be really good or i 'm not interested.i 've been in startup where the vested equity wa really low , and i left ( i wa employee # 1 ) . i 've also talked with numerous people who thought about joining the same startup , and refused due to a number of reason , but low equity wa mentioned a one of the first reason .

( note : i wa a consultant and built a 20 person consulting biz ... and then sold it . i 'll never be an hourly consultant again , if i can swing it ) .

'' and apply it to consulting . ( e.g . provide a service people want ) if you want to optimize your per-hour take ( since you are bound by your time if you work solo that is the only thing you can significantly maximize ) keep on top of your skill and move with the market .

( sound pretty boring to me ) . this is an important question to ask yourself . what is going to be the best step to where you want to be later on ?

'' . i think ... people who are cognizant of ad in any way other than background noise usually `` choose '' to get rid of them . but then , maybe there is a good psyop way around ad blocker . there are other company doing similar thing , like adkrakr . i tried that today out of curiosity ... it brings up a tag cloud , and i clicked on ( among other thing ) `` bird seed '' . what do you know ... i got some bird seed ad . wow.but hey , if you can increase ctrs by 0.01 percent , you 'll be billionaire .

'' basically you always want to generate idea separately , then expand on them in a group . the reason is that a group approach from the start will squash somewhat crazy concept before sufficient time ha been put into making them practical . a a result , the most creative idea are shot down before they are given a chance to be refined.instead , if you generate idea on your own you can spend more time on a half-baked concept in order to round out it flaw . then once it ready , other people can help provide different perspective on the idea without shooting it down outright . therefore i do n't see this article a simply advocating a single founder approach . however , co-founders should harden their new idea on their own before proposing them to each other for critique .

'marketing company ' are sometimes profitable , but rarely maintain a commanding market position for long if they get there in the first place . contrast these with the real product company of our time : apple , google , craigslist , facebook , toyota . the real profit and value are being created by company who focus on actual product . some of these company have little marketing apparatus at all , at least in the sense you 're talking about . this reminds me of a silly aphorism : you rob a bank because that 's where the money is . providing seed funding to 'marketing genius ' is like robbing twenty hot dog stand and hoping that one of them forgot to deposit their earnings that week . it 's only a good plan if you ca n't figure out how to rob the bank .

'' and then ran over to take care of my sister , who wa throwing a tantrum over not being able to have a my little pony doll . i realized i could be the `` good child '' by never asking for stuff . from then on , my parent and i had a tacit agreement : they would buy me anything i wanted , and in return i would n't want much . lesson learned : sibling rivalry can be a powerful motivator.for the second - my parent refused to let u watch any tv other than pb until they 'd sat u down and told u about advertisement . and when they did , the conversation wa basically : `` the commercial are just trying to sell you something . they want to control your behavior , so that you 'll go out and buy what they want . '' i wa 5 year old at the time and could n't bear the idea of anyone controlling my behavior . after all , it wa bad enough when my parent told me what to do . the idea that some nefarious marketing guy would reach through the tv and make me spend money wa just abhorrent . lesson learned : make marketer seem like parent , but with only the evil `` you have to do this ! '' part and not the comforting take-care-of-you parts.the end result of all this ? i 'm 26 year old and still using my high school allowance for spending money . essentially every penny i 've ever earned ha gone into the bank and stayed there .

( i live in one of the few remaining unfashionable block of san francisco for the low low price of about $ 650/sq ft- on nob or russian hill this workbench would probably cover closer to $ 10k worth of floorspace ) . so here 's another way to test a purchase . think about how much floor space the item would cover , and ask yourself if it 's worth the are * $ /sqft .

( you get sql query for free ) . where you expect concurrent access and high load , a client-server still suit better . somebody correct me if i 'm wrong .

( or is it the metabubble ? ) you 'd think that after living through two real bubble we might develop some higher standard . instead , the word `` bubble '' is getting applied to every fad , era , technology , and press release that come along .

( yes , i know why this is impossible with browser feature , but it 's what i expect from a music player ) oh , and it only seems to accept .mp3 file -- i 've got a fair number of .ogg , .wma , .aac , etc . that 's probably my computer 's doing , though , since it would n't be a very good itunes clone without insisting on .aac .
